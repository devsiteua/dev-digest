/**
 * repo-intel — shared contract (Tier 1).
 *
 * This is the SINGLE interface every feature codes against. Library complexity
 * (@ast-grep/napi, dependency-cruiser, graphology, tokenizer) hides behind the
 * `RepoIntel` facade; features (reviews prompt-assembly, blast, onboarding,
 * conventions, phantom-gate, smart-diff) import THIS, never the libraries.
 *
 * Adapted to real code:
 *   - `repos.id` is a `uuid`, so every `repoId` here is a `string`.
 *   - facade-level rows (SymbolRow / SignatureRow / RefRow) mirror the read model.
 *   - adapter-level extraction types live with the astgrep adapter and stay
 *     compatible with `adapters/codeindex/extract.ts` (ExtractedSymbol/Reference).
 *
 * DEGRADED CONTRACT (lead decision — resolves the read-model vs degraded-contract ambiguity):
 *   - Object-returning methods carry an inline `degraded?: boolean` (+ optional
 *     `reason`). See BlastResult / IndexState / RepoMapResult.
 *   - Array-returning methods return `[]` when degraded. Empty = "no enrichment",
 *     which is exactly what every consumer already treats as the fallback path.
 *     The degraded *status/reason* is always observable via `getIndexState()`.
 * This keeps signatures natural (no `{ degraded, data }` wrappers at call sites)
 * while still guaranteeing every consumer can fall back without throwing.
